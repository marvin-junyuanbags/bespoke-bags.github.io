<div class="about-text">
<h3>A Vision Born</h3>
<p>In 2008, in a modest workshop in Quanzhou, China, our founder James Chen had a vision: to create the world's finest custom leather goods by combining traditional craftsmanship with modern innovation. With just five skilled artisans and an unwavering commitment to quality, Bespoke Bags was born.</p>
<p>The early days were challenging but filled with passion. Every bag was crafted by hand, every detail scrutinized, and every customer treated like family. This foundation of excellence and personal attention would become the cornerstone of our company culture.</p>
<p>Our first major breakthrough came when a European luxury brand discovered our work at a trade show. Impressed by our attention to detail and quality, they placed an order that would change our trajectory forever.</p>

<h3>Building Excellence</h3>
<p>By 2010, word of our exceptional quality had spread throughout the luxury goods industry. We expanded our workshop, invested in advanced equipment, and recruited master craftspeople from across Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>The period from 2010 to 2015 was marked by rapid growth and continuous improvement. We established our first quality control laboratory, implemented ISO standards, and began serving luxury brands across three continents.</p>
<p>During this time, we also developed our signature design process, combining traditional leather working techniques with computer-aided design and precision manufacturing. This unique approach allowed us to maintain artisanal quality while scaling production.</p>
